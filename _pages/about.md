<p class="page__lead">I am an Assistant Professor & PI at the <a href="https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/">National Institute of Informatics</a> and <a href="https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/">SOKENDAI</a>, and a Research Scientist at <a href="https://sakana.ai/">Sakana AI</a>. I received my Ph.D. from UTokyo in 2025 and M.S. from PKU. Previously, I interned at Sakana AI, Adobe, and SenseTime.</p>

My research centers on self-improving machine learning, with particular emphasis on generative models for vision and language. I pursue this through three directions:
- **Modeling**: I design efficient foundation models for vision and language tasks, including generative autoregressive and diffusion transformers, and novel architectures that better exploit structure in data and computation.
- **Learning**: I develop data-efficient learning algorithms that uncover and leverage hidden self-supervision in data, including semi-/self-/weakly supervised methods and robust training under limited or noisy labels.
- **Adapting**: I study neural networks in weight space, including model merging, composition, and generation. The goal is to understand and exploit the structure and knowledge encoded in model weights for instant adaptations.

### Opportunity
I offer **funded** positions for interns, PhD students, and postdocs. If interested, email your CV, a brief research background, and the topics you would like to pursue in my group.

1. **Interns** through the [NII International Internship Program](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/international/mouresearch/internship2025-2/index.html) with >100 univs.
2. **Ph.D. students** through the [Informatics Program at SOKENDAI / NII](https://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/).
3. **Ph.D./Postdoc** via [DAAD IFI](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/glo-daad/) for students at German univs. and German nationals.
4. **Research Assistants** from universities in Japan at NII.
