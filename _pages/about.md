I am currently a MEXT-funded Ph.D. candidate at The University of Tokyo, working with Prof. [Toshihiko Yamasaki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rE9iY5MAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I received a Master's degree from Peking University in 2021, advised by Prof. [Chao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeCCx-kAAAAJ&hl=en). Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to collaborate with esteemed researchers including Prof. [Hongyang Zhang](https://hongyanz.github.io/), Dr. [Yuhui Yuan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuyua/), Dr. [Shan You](https://shanyou92.github.io/), and Dr. [Zichuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-H18WY8AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research primarily focuses on *efficient representation learning for both vision and language*. This involves two key aspects: 1) designing *compute-efficient foundation models* to encode the data in a structured format, e.g., efficient Transformers; and 2) devising *label-efficient learning algorithms* that leverage self-supervision to learn the deep learning models.

***I am actively seeking a fulltime research scientist position. Please find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mxf-KHpp4WBkhsfTW2vwzx3mh-ib4iAn/view?usp=sharing) and do not hesitate to contact me if there's a good fit.***
