I am an Assistant Professor and Principal Investigator at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), jointly affiliated with [SOKENDAI](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/). I also work part-time as a Research Scientist at Sakana AI. I received my Ph.D. from [Yamasaki Lab](https://www.cvm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) at The University of Tokyo in 2025 and my M.S. from Peking University, and I have interned at Sakana AI, Adobe, and SenseTime.

My research targets **self-improving machine learning**, with a focus on **generative models for vision and language**. I currently approach this through three complementary fronts:
- **Model / Architecture front**: I design **efficient foundation model** for vision and language tasks, including generative autoregressive and diffusion transformers, and **novel architectures** that better exploit structure in data and computation.
- **Algorithm / Data-efficiency front**: I develop **data-efficient learning algorithms** that uncover and leverage hidden self-supervision in visual and multi-modal data, including semi-/self-/weakly supervised methods and robust training under limited or noisy labels.
- **Weight Space Learning front**: I study **neural networks in weight space**, including model merging, composition, and generation. The goal is to understand and exploit the structure and knowledge of model weights for instant adaptations and model recycle.

### Opportunity
I host *funded* positions for Interns, Ph.D. students and Postdocs. If you are interested, please send me an email with your **CV**, a brief description of your **research background**, and the **potential topics** you intend to explore in my group.
1. **Intern students** through the [NII International Internship Program](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/international/mouresearch/internship2025-2/index.html) with >100 universities;
2. **Ph.D. students** through the [Informatics Program at SOKENDAI / NII](https://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/). All Ph.D. students enrolled at SOKENDAI will be supported by **either a scholarship or an RA**;
3. **DAAD Ph.D./Postdoc**: through the [DAAD IFI-program](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/glo-daad/) for German students or students studying at German universities.
4. **Research Assistants** from domestic universities at NII.
