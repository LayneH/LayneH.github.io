I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Information & Communication Engineering, The University of Tokyo, working with [Prof. Toshihiko Yamasaki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rE9iY5MAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I received a Master's degree from the Department of Machine Intelligence, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Chao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeCCx-kAAAAJ&hl=en). I work closely with [Dr. Shan You](https://shanyou92.github.io/), [Prof. Hongyang Zhang](https://hongyanz.github.io/), and [Dr. Yuhui Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PzyvzksAAAAJ&hl=en).
