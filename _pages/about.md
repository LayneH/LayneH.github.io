I am currently a second Ph.D. student at the Department of Information & Communication Engineering, The University of Tokyo, under the supervision of [Prof. Toshihiko Yamasaki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rE9iY5MAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I received the Master's degree from the Department of Machine Intelligence, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeCCx-kAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include self-supervised representation learning, learning from noisy data, and vision transformers.
