<p class="page__lead">I am an Assistant Professor and Principal Investigator at the <a href="https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/">National Institute of Informatics</a>, jointly affiliated with <a href="https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/">SOKENDAI</a>, and a Research Scientist at Sakana AI. My research focuses on self-improving machine learning for vision and language.</p>

I received my Ph.D. from [Yamasaki Lab](https://www.cvm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) at The University of Tokyo in 2025 and my M.S. from Peking University, and I have interned at Sakana AI, Adobe, and SenseTime.

### Research Focus
- **Model / Architecture**: efficient foundation models for vision and language, including autoregressive and diffusion transformers.
- **Algorithm / Data-efficiency**: semi-/self-/weakly supervised learning and robust training under limited or noisy labels.
- **Weight Space Learning**: model merging, composition, and generation for rapid adaptation.

### Selected Publications
- **GreenMIM** (NeurIPS 2022) — [paper](/publications/2022-05-GreenMIM/)
- **LEWEL** (CVPR 2022) — [paper](/publications/2022-03-LEWEL/)
- **SAT** (T-PAMI 2022) — [paper](/publications/2021-01-SAT/)
