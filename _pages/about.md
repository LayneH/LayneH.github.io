I am an Assistant Professor and Pricipal Investigator at the [National Intitute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/), jointly affiliated with [The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/).
I obtained my Ph.D. at The University of Tokyo in 2025 and my Master's degree from Peking University in 2021. 
Throughout my academic journey, I was also fortunate to have several wonderful internships at Sakana AI, Adobe and SenseTime.

My research focuses on **self-improving machine learning**, primarily for vision data. I approach this challenge through two key aspects: *learning algorithms* and *model design*. 
- **On the algorithmic front**, I develop methods to uncover and leverage the hidden self-supervision inherent within data, *e.g.*, [SAT](../_publications/2021-01-SAT.md), [LEWEL](../_publications/2022-03-LEWEL.md), and [SimMatch](../_publications/2022-03-SimMatch.md).
- **On the model front**, I design 'fast learners', foundational models that operate efficiently concerning both human- and self-supervisions, *e.g.*, [ISA](../_publications/2019-07-ISA.md), [OCNet](../_publications/2018-09-OCNet.md), and [GreenMIM](../_publications/2022-05-GreenMIM.md).

### Opportunity
I will be hosting
- *funded* oversea students through the [NII International Internship Program](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/international/mouresearch/).
  and Research Assiatnts at NII.
- Ph.D. students through the [Informatics Program at SOKENDAI/NII](https://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/).

Please send me an email with your CV and a few sentences decribing your research interests.
