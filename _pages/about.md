I am an Assistant Professor and Principal Investigator at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/), jointly affiliated with [The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI)](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/). I also work part-time as a Research Scientist at Sakana AI.  
I received my Ph.D. from [Yamasaki Lab](https://www.cvm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) at The University of Tokyo in 2025 and my M.S. from Peking University, and I have held research internships at Sakana AI, Adobe, and SenseTime.

My research targets **self-improving machine learning**, with a focus on **generative models, computer vision, and vision–language models**. I currently approach this through three complementary fronts:

- **Model / Architecture front**:  
  I design and analyze **efficient foundation model architectures** for generative vision and vision–language tasks, including autoregressive and diffusion-based models, as well as large-scale transformers. This includes work on compact and scalable architectures such as [ISA](../_publications/2019-07-ISA.md), [OCNet](../_publications/2018-09-OCNet.md), and [GreenMIM](../_publications/2022-05-GreenMIM.md), and will extend to **novel and bio-inspired architectures** that better exploit structure in data and computation.

- **Algorithm / Data-efficiency front**:  
  I develop **data-efficient learning algorithms** that uncover and leverage hidden self-supervision in visual and multi-modal data, including semi-/self-/weakly supervised methods and robust training under limited or noisy labels. Examples include [SAT](../_publications/2021-01-SAT.md), [LEWEL](../_publications/2022-03-LEWEL.md), and [SimMatch](../_publications/2022-03-SimMatch.md).

- **Weight Space Learning front**:  
  I study **neural networks in weight space**, including model merging, composition, and generation. The goal is to understand and exploit the structure and knowledge of model weights for instant adaptations and model recycle.

### Opportunity

I host *funded* positions for:

1. **Intern students** through the [NII International Internship Program](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/about/international/mouresearch/internship2025-2/index.html);
2. **Ph.D. students** through the [Informatics Program at SOKENDAI / NII](https://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/); 
3. **DAAD Ph.D./Post Doc**: through the [DAAD IFI-program](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/glo-daad/) for German students or students studying at German universities.
4. **Research Assistants** from domestic universities at NII.

All Ph.D. students enrolled at SOKENDAI will be supported by **either a scholarship or a research assistantship (RA)**.

If you are interested, please send me an email with your **CV**, a brief description of your **research background**, and the **potential research topics** you would like to explore in my group.
