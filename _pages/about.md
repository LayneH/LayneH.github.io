I am currently a MEXT-funded Ph.D. candidate at The University of Tokyo, working with [Prof. Toshihiko Yamasaki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rE9iY5MAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I received a Master's degree from Peking University in 2021, advised by [Prof. Chao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeCCx-kAAAAJ&hl=en).
My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and computer vision, especially solving vision problems with self-supervised representation learning and deep neural networks, e.g., Vision Transformers.
